Oct 21 1997 <gbarr@pobox.com>

	Error.pm #0.10

	- Added proceed clause, the return value from the proceed block
	  will be returned by throw.
	- try will now return the result from the try block
	  or from the catch
	- Changed except clause handling so that block is only evaluated
	  once, the first time the result is required.
	- Changed catch and proceed blocks to accept two arguments. The
	  second argument is a reference to a scalar, which if set to true
	  will cause Error to continue looking for a catch/proceed block
	  when the block returns.
